# Case Study Proposal
## Wealthfront

### What is it

Wealthfront Inc. is an automated investment service firm based in Palo Alto, California founded by Andy Rachleff and Dan Carroll in 2008. As of January 2019, Wealthfront had more than $11.4 billion of assets under management. Wealthfront is considered a "robo-advisor" investment service.

Wealthfront has built client trust by offering free management on the first $5,000 — with NerdWallet’s promotion — but the company’s stock-level tax-loss harvesting service really shines, adding as much as 2% to annual investment performance for eligible accounts.


### Why this matters

This helps the average person invest in the markets to get a return on their savings for very low fees, with very little to no knowledge on investing. 

By investing via algorithms, you take out a certain amount of bias and potential error related to human factors. 

### Why this may be more interesting

Wealthfront uses machine learning in their algorithms, which should start to recognize patterns over time to help produce better returns.
